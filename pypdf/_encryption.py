        Algorithm 2: Computing an encryption key.

        a) Pad or truncate the password string to exactly 32 bytes. If the
           password string is more than 32 bytes long,
           use only its first 32 bytes; if it is less than 32 bytes long, pad it
           by appending the required number of
           additional bytes from the beginning of the following padding string:

           the first 32 - n bytes of the padding string to the end
           of the password string. If the password string is empty
           (zero-length), meaning there is no user password,
           substitute the entire padding string in its place.

        b) Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the result of step (a)
           as input to this function.
        c) Pass the value of the encryption dictionary’s O entry to the

           not being encrypted, pass 4 bytes with

           dictionary’s Length entry.

        Algorithm 3.2a Computing an encryption key.

        To understand the algorithm below, it is necessary to treat the O and U
        strings in the Encrypt dictionary as made up of three sections.
        The first 32 bytes are a hash value (explained below). The next 8 bytes
        are called the Validation Salt. The final 8 bytes are called the Key Salt.

        1. The password string is generated from Unicode input by processing the
           input string with the SASLprep (IETF RFC 4013) profile of
           stringprep (IETF RFC 3454), and then converting to a UTF-8
           representation.
        2. Truncate the UTF-8 representation to 127 bytes if it is longer than
           127 bytes.
        3. Test the password against the owner key by computing the SHA-256 hash
           of the UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of owner
           Validation Salt, concatenated with the 48-byte U string. If the
           32-byte result matches the first 32 bytes of the O string, this is
           the owner password.
           Compute an intermediate owner key by computing the SHA-256 hash of
           the UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of owner Key Salt,
           concatenated with the 48-byte U string. The 32-byte result is the
           key used to decrypt the 32-byte OE string using AES-256 in CBC mode
           with no padding and an initialization vector of zero.
           The 32-byte result is the file encryption key.
        4. Test the password against the user key by computing the SHA-256 hash
           of the UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of user
           Validation Salt. If the 32 byte result matches the first 32 bytes of
           the U string, this is the user password.
           Compute an intermediate user key by computing the SHA-256 hash of the
           UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of user Key Salt.
           The 32-byte result is the key used to decrypt the 32-byte
           UE string using AES-256 in CBC mode with no padding and an
           initialization vector of zero. The 32-byte result is the file
           encryption key.
        5. Decrypt the 16-byte Perms string using AES-256 in ECB mode with an
           initialization vector of zero and the file encryption key as the key.
           Verify that bytes 9-11 of the result are the characters ‘a’, ‘d’, ‘b’.
           Bytes 0-3 of the decrypted Perms entry, treated as a little-endian
           integer, are the user permissions.
           They should match the value in the P key.

        a) Obtain the object number and generation number from the object
           identifier of the string or stream to be encrypted
           (see 7.3.10, "Indirect Objects"). If the string is a direct object,
           use the identifier of the indirect object containing it.
        b) For all strings and streams without crypt filter specifier; treating
           the object number and generation number as binary integers, extend
           the original n-byte encryption key to n + 5 bytes by appending the
           low-order 3 bytes of the object number and the low-order 2 bytes of
           the generation number in that order, low-order byte first.
           (n is 5 unless the value of V in the encryption dictionary is greater
           than 1, in which case n is the value of Length divided by 8.)
           If using the AES algorithm, extend the encryption key an additional
           4 bytes by adding the value “sAlT”, which corresponds to the
           hexadecimal values 0x73, 0x41, 0x6C, 0x54. (This addition is done for
           backward compatibility and is not intended to provide additional
           security.)
        c) Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the result of step (b) as
           input to this function.
        d) Use the first (n + 5) bytes, up to a maximum of 16, of the output
           from the MD5 hash as the key for the RC4 or AES symmetric key
           algorithms, along with the string or stream data to be encrypted.
